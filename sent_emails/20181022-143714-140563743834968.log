Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address admin@admin.com. Follow the link below:
http://localhost:8000/dashboard/password_reset_confirm/MQ/50n-c9e7340233d1d97a50a9/

In case you forgot your Django Maharudra username: krishna

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying
to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Maharudra Team
